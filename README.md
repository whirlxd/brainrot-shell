# Brainrot Shell

Are you tired of using the same old regular shell? Are you a true skibidi sigma? Introducing **Brainrot Shell**â€”the new shell that's only for those who know ðŸ’€

Originally built as a CodeCrafters "Build Your Own X" challenge, Brainrot Shell has been upgraded to be actually useful with added features.

## Prerequisites

### Operating System
- **Windows** (untested on other operating systems but should work the same way)

### Python
- Python 3 installed and added to your system PATH

You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Brainrot Shell on your Windows system:

### 1. Download the Brainrot Shell Repository

#### Option 1: Clone the Repository with Git
If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:

```bash
# Replace `repository-url` with the actual URL of the Brainrot Shell repository
git clone https://github.com/whirlxd/brainrot-shell.git
```

#### Option 2: Download ZIP
1. Visit the GitHub repository page.
2. Click on the **"Code"** button and select **"Download ZIP"**.
3. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

### 2. Run the Installation Script

#### Navigate to the Project Directory
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Brainrot Shell files:

```bash
cd path-to-brainrot-shell-folder
```

#### Run `install.bat`
Execute the installation script by typing:

```bash
install.bat
```

> **Note:** You may need to run Command Prompt as an administrator to ensure the script can modify system environment variables.

#### Follow the On-Screen Instructions
The script will:
- Copy `brainrot.py` and the `commands` directory to `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts`.
- Add `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts` to your system PATH if it's not already included.
- Create a wrapper batch file `brainrot.bat` to run the shell.

#### Restart Command Prompt
Close all Command Prompt windows and open a new one to apply the changes to your PATH.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Brainrot Shell.

### Starting the Shell
Open Command Prompt and type:

```bash
brainrot
```

You should see the Brainrot Shell prompt:

```
Brainrot $
```

### Available Commands
Brainrot Shell is a toy shell but still incredibly useful. Here are some of the commands you can use:

## Troubleshooting

### `'brainrot' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- Ensure that the installation script ran successfully.
- Verify that `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts` is added to your system PATH.
- Restart Command Prompt to apply the changes to your PATH.

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'commands'`
- Ensure that the `commands` directory is located in `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts`.
- The `install.bat` script should have copied the `commands` directory. Try running the installation script again.

### `Python is not recognized`
- Ensure that Python 3.x is installed and added to your system PATH.
- You can verify by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## Uninstallation

To remove Brainrot Shell from your system:

### Delete Installed Files
Remove the following from `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts`:
- `brainrot.py`
- `brainrot.bat`
- `commands` directory

### Remove the Scripts Directory from PATH (Optional)
If you added `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts` to your PATH and no longer need it, you can remove it:

1. Search for **"Environment Variables"** in the Start menu.
2. Select **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
3. Click on **"Environment Variables"**.
4. Under **"User variables"** or **"System variables"**, find and select PATH.
5. Click **"Edit"** and remove `%USERPROFILE%\Scripts` from the list.

#### Restart Command Prompt
Close all Command Prompt windows and open a new one to apply the changes.
